# Predicting-Credit-Risk-Default-using-Machine-Leaning
This project aimed at training two algorithms 'Random Forest' and 'XGBoost' into building machine learning models which can predict default risk.

Data cleaning was done, exploratory data analysis was done with Pandas Profiling, the problem of imbalanced data was observed and solved by using the Upsampling method, categorical data was encoded using label encoder, data normalisation was done wit MinMax Scaler.

Model was trained with accuracy measured and reliabilty of classification measured with Confusion Matrix.

Hyperparameter Optimisation was done to improve the model peformance using RandomisedSearchCV in Sklearn.

Finally , the models were saved  using pickle , enabling them to be available for deployment!
